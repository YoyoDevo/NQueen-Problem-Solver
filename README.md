# NQueen-Problem-Solver

Implements the following local search algorithms to solve the n-queen problem:
  1) Straight-forward steepest-ascent hill climbing 
  2) Genetic Algorithm
  
Generates a large number of n-queens instances (>100) and solves them. Measures the percentage of solved problems, search costs and the average running time.
